# CTFWriteups
Cybersecurity Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are contests where participants, often individuals or teams, engage in simulated cybersecurity challenges. These challenges typically encompass a wide range of topics within cybersecurity, including cryptography, reverse engineering, web security, binary exploitation, forensics, and more.

During a CTF competition, participants are tasked with finding hidden flags, which are usually strings of text or unique identifiers, within vulnerable systems or applications. Flags are often located by identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities, analyzing network traffic, deciphering encrypted messages, or solving puzzles.

CTF competitions are not only a platform for honing technical skills and knowledge but also encourage collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Participants are required to think creatively and strategically to overcome various obstacles within a limited timeframe.

*CTFs are organized by folder and seperated based on category (Web, reverse, crpyto, etc) and an explentation of how I solved the problem.

*I usually pick problems that I liked solving to post as a writeup
